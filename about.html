                <h2>Company History</h2>
                <p>Muthure Medical Center was officially opened in January 2019. At this point, we only had outpatient and laboratory services. In June the same year, with support from the Ministry of Health, we introduced well-baby clinic, family planning, antenatal, and postnatal care clinic. Fast forward to 2022, we have introduced ultrasound and have now incorporated telemedicine and homecare in our services. Our hospital has seen great milestones and still has a big potential and vision for growth.</p>
